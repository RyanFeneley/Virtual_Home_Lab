# Virtual_Home_Lab

## Project Overview

This is a home lab I built to simulate a small enterprise IT environment and gain hands-on experience with core systems administration and security tools. The lab is entirely virtual, using VMware Workstation and evaluation ISOs of Windows Server 2019. I designed this lab as part of my personal development while preparing for an entry-level IT support role and a long-term career in network security.

The goal of the lab was to understand how real organizations structure their networks, manage users, enforce security policies, and organize IT operations ‚Äî and to prove that I can do it myself.

## What I Learned

Over the course of this project, I:
- Installed and configured **Windows Server 2019** on a virtual machine
- Set up a custom **domain controller** with **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**
- Created **Organizational Units (OUs)** to simulate company departments
- Added and managed **user accounts** within those OUs
- Installed and used the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)** to define and apply **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** that control user permissions, lock screens, and other security policies
- Understood how to **structure a network logically** and apply **policy-based management** to it

## Tools Used

- VMware Workstation Pro 17  
- Windows Server 2019 Evaluation ISO  
- Active Directory Domain Services  
- Group Policy Management Console  
- Snapshots and basic VM networking

## Purpose

I created this lab to move beyond theoretical knowledge and start building the same systems used in real IT environments. By manually installing and configuring each part, I developed a deeper understanding of:

- How domains and authentication actually work
- How policy enforcement works at scale using GPOs
- The importance of structure and access control in secure environments
- The type of day-to-day tasks entry-level IT roles are expected to perform

This experience directly prepares me for IT support, help desk, and system administration positions. It also lays a strong foundation for my long-term goal of becoming a Network Security Engineer ‚Äî giving me real insight into how infrastructure is built before it's secured.
